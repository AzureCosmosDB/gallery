    "description": "Join us to learn about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, a powerful pattern for building advanced AI chat applications. We'll cover the essentials of vector search, embeddings, and indexes, and demonstrate how to efficiently store and retrieve transactional and vector data together in Azure Cosmos DB. This session will guide you through creating a low-code RAG application in Azure OpenAI Studio with just a database, coding the retrieval component in Python, and understanding when to choose Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore for your RAG implementations. Whether you're new to these technologies or seeking to enhance your skills, this session promises to be a valuable learning experience!",
