# Contributing

_We are still working on our contribution guidelines. In the meantime, please feel free to open issues and provide feedback on how to streamline the process._

## Introduction

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact <opencode@microsoft.com> with any additional questions or comments.

This will help us to understand the issue and resolve it as quickly as possible. Be sure to include as much information as you can, including configuration files, logs, and hosting model.
